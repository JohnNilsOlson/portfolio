          <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <p>Who</p>
              <p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <p>What</p>
              <p>You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Learn when to stop. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <p>Where</p>
              <p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. This is the way you take out your flustrations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <p>Why</p>
              <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Let that brush dance around there and play. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.</p>

            <p>School</p>
            <p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. And maybe a little bush lives there. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.</p>

            <p>Work</p>
            <p>You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?</p>
