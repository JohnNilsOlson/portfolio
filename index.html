            <p>School</p>
            <p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. And maybe a little bush lives there. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Work</p>
            <p>You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?</p>

            <p>We don't have anything but happy trees here. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Don't be bashful drop me a line. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. A little happy sunlight shining through there.</p>

            <p>Activites</p>
            <p>Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>

            <p>Practical</p>
            <p>A beautiful little sunset. This is truly an almighty mountain. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. In your world you have total and absolute power.</p>
